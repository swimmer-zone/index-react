			IndeX is a band, which consists out of Marc (bass), Daniel (drums / vocals), Patrick (guitar),
			Saba (keyboard), Niels (vocals / guitar) and Stella (violin).
		</p>
		<p>
			The name 'IndeX' exists since the year 2000. We operated three years as a punkband. Our former bassplayer
			stopped and just before the band stopped entirely, it resurrected into reggaemusic. Later on, the keyboard
			player and the singer joined the band.<br />
			Nowadays we make music based on reggae, but with many influences from other styles, such as punk, funk,
			ska, dub and more...
